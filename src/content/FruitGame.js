        <h4>What is it:</h4>
        <p>
          Beautifruit is a leisure mobile game. Users need to feed the girl with
          healthy fruit and avoid oily food to become pretty. The interaction is
          pretty simpleâ€”user shoots the fruit to the girl and oily food to the
          rubbish bin and avoid it crashing with the other moving fruit at the
          same time.
        </p>
        <h4>What I have learnt in this project:</h4>
        <p>
          The Beautifruit game is infact a very logical game. I created a table
          to show the relationship between different fruits and which fruit is
          good for which parts of the body.
