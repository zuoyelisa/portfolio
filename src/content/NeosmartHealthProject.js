        <p>
          Neosmart Health (NSH) is a technology start-up operating in preventive
          healthcare business. Different from the traditional health care,
          Neosmart uses self assement data, selected medical and environmental
          analysis, and genetic data to create personalized recommendations and
          a plan to improve client's health. This project aims at providing
          Neosmart Health's customers a digital service with a consistent
          customer experience. Started from scratch, weâ€™ve designed and launched
          an website for explaining the service and functioning as the online
          portal. The portal serves as an easy booking system to make a smooth
          online-offline experience and a dashboard to monitor visuallized
          health data.
